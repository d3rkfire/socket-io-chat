# socket-io-chat
A remake of my java socket chat demo, but this time with Node.js and Socket.io. This is just a simple demo, so there is no encryption.  

Run with: Node.js  
The needed packages are Express and Socket.io. They are already listed in package.json, so you only need to run: npm install
